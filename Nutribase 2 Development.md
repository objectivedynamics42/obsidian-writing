# Technology Considerations
## Data Storage
### Room
Room is part of Android's Jetpack architecture components and provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, making database operations more robust, easier, and efficient. You can either:
* Populate the database at runtime
* Deploy your app with a pre-built database
#### Database Initialisation
##### Building the database at runtime
* Using data from github
* How will we manage database updates?
  When possible, pull the data files from github adding any new entries
##### Using a prebuilt database
It's possible to deploy a pre-built Room database with an Android application. This approach can be useful if you want to initialize your database with predefined data. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. First, create the database using *SQLite* tools on your development machine. You can use tools like SQLite Database Browser or Android Studio's SQLite Database Inspector to create and populate the database
2. Place the pre-built database file in the `assets` folder of your Android project. The `assets` folder should be located in the `src/main` directory of your project
3. Modify your Room database class to copy the database from the assets folder to the device's internal storage when the app is first launched
